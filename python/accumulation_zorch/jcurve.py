"""Jit-able Pasta-G1 Pedersen commitments — the jit/GPU-exportable replacement
for `curve.py`'s `zk_dtypes` CPU group ops (the jit/GPU-exportable port).

`curve.pedersen_commit` sums `g * cv.fr(s)` over the affine dtype — CPU-only group
ops that don't lower to a jit/GPU kernel. Here the commitment is `lax.msm` (the
Pasta G1 MSM kernel), and any field reduction feeding it (`M·z`)
runs as vectorized jax over the `fr` dtype. The op is GPU-ready for Phase 2;
Phase 1 gates it on CPU (`JAX_PLATFORMS=cpu`).

A curve appears only where a host-side array is built from the curve's dtypes
(`stack_affine` over `cv.g1`, the `cv.fr` randomizer/challenge arrays); the
commitment kernels are dtype-agnostic — the dtype rides on the input arrays — so
they name no curve.

Scalar-mul and point-add both route through `lax.msm`, never bare `*`/`+`: jit
`point × scalar` is byte-wrong and jit `affine + affine` is an invalid EC type
combination, so `s·P` is `lax.msm([s], [P])` and `A + B` is `lax.msm([1, 1], [A, B])`.
